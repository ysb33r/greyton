Greyton - A DSL to make jclouds Groovy
======================================


Origin of Name
--------------

I needed a name starting with *Gr*, so I named after a small town in the Western Cape, South Africa. Being a
South African name it needs to be pronounded with a much more guttaral *G* that what one might be used to for *Groovy*.
However, no one would complain too much if you have a softer *Gr*.
